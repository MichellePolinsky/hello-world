    <h1>Powerlifting</h1>

    <p>Powerlifting is the best sport, in my opinion. Anyone can do it. To begin powerlifting you need the following</p>
    <ul> 
      
      <li>Gym</li>
      <li>Shoes*</li>
      <li>Belt</li>
      <li>Wrist Wraps</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <font size=2>*Different shoes are recommended for each lift. Squat shoes should be of firm bottom and a lift in the heel. For deadlift you will want a flat thin sole. Bench shoes can be whatever feels most comfortable to you. Some people prefer a regular sneaker and some like to wear their squat shoes</font></p>
